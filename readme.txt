Welcome to the game Set! Thank you for playing our game!

This game requires a little setting up before you can actually play it, so please follow the instructions listed below:
1. Firstly, make sure you have the latest version of Python (3.8.5 or newer) installed on your computer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
    and follow the instructions for the IDE you have selected. You can pick whichever, neither is objectively harder than the other to use.
3. If you haven't already, unzip the game files to a folder where you can easily find them.
Visual Studio Code:
    4. Upon opening Visual Studio Code, open the 'File' menu in the upper left corner of the screen and select 'Open Folder'.
    5. Locate the folder that contains the game files and open it. (NOTE: Make sure you open the entire folder, not just an  
        individual file, or you might encounter errors.)
    6. In the bottom left corner, make sure your Python Interpreter is set to 'Python 3.8.x 32-bit'. (3.8.5 or newer)
        6a. If it simply says 'Select Python Interpreter...', locate the folder your Python installation is in. It should be in a 
            folder named 'Python38-32', and the file is named python.exe.
        6b. If Visual Studio Code prompts you to install packages for Python or pylint, go ahead and install them. 
            You need them to use Python in Visual Studio Code.
    7. Press the 'Play' button (green button) in the upper right corner of the screen. The Python terminal should 
        pop up and give you a couple of errors. You can ignore them for now.
        7a. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Shift+` in Visual Studio Code to open a terminal window.
    8. In the newly opened terminal window, type the following commands:
        NOTE: If you get an error message saying "The term 'pip' is not recognized as the name of a ...",
              add 'py -m ' in front of the commands before running them in the terminal.
        8a. pip install pillow
        8b. pip install playsound
        8c. (MAC USERS ONLY) pip install pyobjc
PyCharm:
    4. Upon opening PyCharm, if you already have a project open, go into the 'File' menu in the upper left corner and select 'Open'.
        If you just have the welcome screen, select 'Open'.
    5. Locate the folder that contains the game files and open it. (NOTE: Make sure you open the entire folder, not just an  
        individual file, or you might encounter errors.)
    6. PyCharm should detect your Python installation by default, so you won't have to manually locate and input it as your interpreter.
    7. In the bottom of the window, you should see a thin toolbar with some tabs. One of them should say 'Terminal'. Click it.
    8. In the newly opened terminal window, type the following commands:
        NOTE: If you get an error message saying "The term 'pip' is not recognized as the name of a ...",
              add 'py -m ' in front of the commands before running them in the terminal.
        8a. pip install pillow
        8b. pip install playsound
        8c. (MAC USERS ONLY) pip install pyobjc
    9. In the upper right corner, there should be a button that says 'Edit Configurations'. Click it.
    10. In the window that opens up, click the '+' in the upper left, then select the second option, named 'Python'.
    11. In the 'Script Path' line, the first line in the 'Configuration' tab, click the folder icon to open the file explorer.
    12. Locate where you have the 'set.py' file (it should be in the folder you unzipped the files in), and open that file.

From this point, on either system or IDE, you should be able to play the game by click the green 'Play' button in the upper right corner.
Thank you so much for playing our game, and good luck! - Spencer Armstrong & Nathan Cox
